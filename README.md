# LearnIt
LearnIt is a Telegram Bot, with handle @LearnItbot, initally created to help people to memorize other languagesâ€™ vocabulary, but expanded from languages to anything you can put in cards to memorize!.<br />
<br />
The main ideia is: if you know a word and don't want to forget it, you can add the word and relate it to a text, image and/or audio. After it, the bot will occasionally send you content you added (audio, image and/or text), and then ask you what the content is representing. Then you can answer the question and the bot will tell you wheter your answer is correct or not, and give you the correct answer in case what you sent was wrong. <br />
<br />
After answering a question, you will be asked to grade your performance, and based on that, the algorithm will decide which words will be more frequently sent to you. This is done based on the supermemo2 algorithm. You can read more about it at http://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm. <br />
<br />
There is also a review feature, in which the user can choose the topics to be reviewed and a number of cards to receive. The bot will send random cards of the choosen topics to the user to answer. <br />
