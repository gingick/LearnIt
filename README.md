# LingoBot
LingoBot is a Telegram Bot, with handle @theLingoBot, created to help people to memorize other laguagesâ€™ vocabulary. The main ideia is: if you know a word in a certain language and don't want to forget it, you can add the word in the foreign language and relate it to a translation, images or audio. After it, the bot will occasionally send you content you added (audio, image or translation) and the respective language, and then ask you what the image or audio is representing. Then you can answer the question and the bot will tell you if your answer is correct or not, and give you the correct answer in case what you sent was wrong.
After answering a question, you will be asked to grade your performance, and based on that, the algorithm will decide which words will be more frequently sent to you. This is done based on the supermemo2 algorithm. You can read more about it at http://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm.

The bot is still in development and is not guaranteed that it will be online all the time.
